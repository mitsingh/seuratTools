# Reformat Metadata

Arbitrary metadata can be appended to the data based on the results of exploratory data analysis. Metadata addition can be executed by uploading a csv with rownames matching cell ids with new variables as columns. 

Additionally, two or more columns of the metadata can be combined into one single column by simply selecting the columns of interest in Seurat Metadata Object Columns and by providing a new name for the merged column.
